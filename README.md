# Skills Check for Assessment # 3

The purpose of this skill check is to gauge your current level of skill and
understanding of this section's content so far.

This problem may feel challenging, and that is OK. You will need to use Polya's
problem solving framework to understand the problem, make a plan, carry out the
plan, and look back and improve your solution.

Your instructors will use the results of the skill check to target specific
areas to get you ready for the upcoming assessment.

## Setup

1. Download the starter from the "Download Project" button at the bottom of this
   page.
2. Rename the folder to include your first name and last name. For example, if
   your name is "Jane Doe", then name your folder `jane-doe-<name-of-starter>`
3. Open the project folder in the terminal and run `npm install` to install
   dependencies

## Instructions

Read the instructions in the __problems/ending-position.js__. Implement the
problem and run the following command in your terminal to test your code:

```sh
npm test test/01-ending-position-spec.js
```

As you are working on the problems, you can run the local test cases for
debugging purposes by uncommenting the code that prints the test cases and
running the following command:

```sh
node problems/ending-position.js
```

The goal IS NOT to pass 100% of the test specs. Just try to pass as many of the
test specs as possible. If you struggle through the problem, share where you got
stuck on the optional survey in the student home portal - this will also help your 
instructors plan extra support for you.

## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. **Delete the `node_modules` directory**
2. Zip up the project folder
3. Submit the zip file on App Academy Open
